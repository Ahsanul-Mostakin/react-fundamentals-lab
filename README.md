# ⚛️ React

This repository contains my early React practice projects and experiments.
It focuses on building a strong foundation in core React concepts such as
components, state, props, and common UI patterns.

🔔 Note:
For my main, structured, and production-oriented React journey
covering React → MERN → AI through real-world, project-based work
(actively maintained),
